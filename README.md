## Who is that man?

Just a Humble (TX) Game Producer who's donated 14-inches of hair twice now! Recently graduated with a Master's degree for Game Production at SMU Guildhall and loved every minute of it! Now a producer at [Stray Kite Studios](https://www.straykitestudios.com/) - and helped launch [**Wartorn**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/)!

My personality can be summed up in my answer to the following question:

Q: What song lyrics go with "Wake me up..?" 
A: "before you Go-Go!"
